Prague, Czechia | Berlin, Germany · US citizen · English (native speaker) | German (elementary) | Czech (basic)

I build measurement and decision systems that turn messy, high-stakes processes into repeatable wins. My work spans recruiting analytics, ML-assisted operations, and executive-grade metrics leaders can actually use.

**Focus:** metric design & governance · end-to-end data products · ML for Ops · AWS/Snowflake analytics  
**Tooling:** Python, R, SQL · AWS (S3, Lambda, Transcribe, Athena, Redshift, QuickSight) · Snowflake

- **Signal Spiral Template**  — Seasonality spiral for recurring time-series (recruiting, product, ops).
-   [Repo](https://github.com/chsmithiii/signal-spiral) · [![CI](https://github.com/chsmithiii/signal-spiral/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chsmithiii/signal-spiral/actions/workflows/ci.yml) · Monthly/weekly/daily; PNG export.
- **COVID & Econ Indicators** — Join OWID daily with World Bank macro (GINI, PPP, etc.) 2019→present.
-   [Repo](https://github.com/chsmithiii/COVID_and_Econ_Indicators_by_Country) · [![Data update](https://github.com/chsmithiii/COVID_and_Econ_Indicators_by_Country/actions/workflows/update-data.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chsmithiii/COVID_and_Econ_Indicators_by_Country/actions/workflows/update-data.yml) · Weekly auto-refresh.
- **AWS Transcribe Pipeline** — S3 → Lambda → Transcribe → Athena; production-ish scaffolding with IaC notes. *(repo link coming)*

If you want early access, open an issue and I’ll prioritize docs/examples.

## Playbooks I Use
- **From ambiguity to metrics:** intake → system map → signal inventory → candidate metrics → validity/causality checks → adoption plan.  
- **Decision geometry:** choose the right “space” (Euclidean / spherical / hyperbolic / twisted) to match complexity and stakeholder perspective.  
- **Analytics stack:** descriptive → diagnostic → predictive → prescriptive — tied to adoption, durability, and who benefits.

## Writing & Talks
- *Measuring feature impact beyond the “tyranny of metrics”* — story, pitfalls, and fixes. *(link)*
- *Decision geometry & story arcs for data* — narrative structures for time-series communication. *(link)*

## Now
- Productizing **Metric Hunter** for faster KPI discovery.  
- Packaging an **AWS Transcribe** demo with reproducible infra and a one-click run.  
- Teaching analytics students how logistics actually runs on measurement.
